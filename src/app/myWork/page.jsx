        My Work
      </h1>
      <p className="m-3">
        As a Front-End Developer with 5 plus years of experience, I specialize
        in creating responsive web applications using frameworks like ReactJS,
        NextJS & Javascript. I'm good at managing state with Redux and using
        build tools like Webpack to streamline development. I'm also proficient
        in HTML5 and Bootstrap for designing smooth user interfaces.
        Additionally, my Java expertise empowers me to build robust, scalable
        applications capable of handling complex data and business logic. I
        leverage this knowledge to contribute effectively to software
        architecture and design principles within Agile teams.{""}
